# Order Room v1.5.5

This build includes a `404.html` that mirrors `index.html` so GitHub Pages routes all SPA paths to the app.

## Deploy steps (Project Pages)
1. Make the repo **Public**.
2. Settings → Pages → Source: **Deploy from a branch**. Branch: **main**, Folder: **/** (root). Save.
3. Upload all files from this zip to the repository root (replace older files).
4. Open: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

If you already use a custom domain (CNAME), ensure DNS points to GitHub Pages and the CNAME file is correct.
